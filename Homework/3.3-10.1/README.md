1. Review the code for each recursive program binarySearch() on page 147 and answer the following questions.
- What is the greatest similarity to any recursive program we have investigated so far? Briefly explain you answer.
- What is the greatest difference to any recursive program we have investigated so far? Briefly explain you answer.
- Identify the “base case” as described in the Key Concepts box on page 116.
- In your own words, describe why binarySearch() is an effective solution for the search problem?
2. In Section 10.1, select a sentence that makes the best case for measuring the efficiency of algorithms. Briefly explain why you chose this passage.
3. Algorithm growth rates are described on pages 467-475. In no more than one paragraph, summarize the section. What passage did you find most confusing?

### Part B:
For CSC 111:
- Complete the Linear and Binary Search programming activities started in class.
- Review for Exam 1 using the study guide.

For CSC 111L: Complete the LinearBinarySearch Activity, by writing the SearchMethods class and testing it with the provided TestSearchMethods.java file. Upload the completed SearchMethods.java to Blackboard.
