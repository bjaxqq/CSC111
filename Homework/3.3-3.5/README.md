# Homework 3.3-3.5

### Part A:
Read sections 3.3-3.5 and 6.1 in your textbook (Walls and Mirrors) and answer the following question in the Sections 3.3 to 3.5 and 6.1 Reading Journal on Blackboard.
1. The code for four recursive programs are on the following pages:
    - fact() on page 118
    - rabbit() on page 137
    - binarySearch() on page 147
    - solveTowers() on page 156

Review the code for each recursive program above, and answer the following questions.
- What is the greatest similarity among all four recursive programs? Briefly explain you answer.
- What is the greatest difference among all four recursive programs? Briefly explain you answer.
- For each, identify the “base case” as described in the Key Concepts box on page 116.

2. The Eight Queens Problem is described in section 6.1. Clearly explain why it is a good candidate for a recursive solution. (You might consider using the four questions on page 116 as a guide.)

### Part B:
Recursion: In computer science, recursion refers to a function or subroutine that calls itself, and it is a fundamental paradigm in programming. A recursive program is used for solving problems that can be broken down into sub-problems of the same type, doing so until the problem is easy enough to solve directly. http://www.categories.acsl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Recursive_Functions

Problem 1: Write a program to evaluate $g(n)$ for a given integer value, $n$. In particular, find $g(11)$ given: $g(x)=g(x-3)+1$ if $x>0$, $3x$ otherwise.

Problem 2: Write a program to evaluate $h(n)$ for a given integer value, $n$. In particular, find $h(13)$ given: $h(x)=h(x-7)+1$ when $x>5$, $x$ when $0<=x<=5$, $h(x+3)$ when $x<0$.

Problem 3: Write a program to evaluate $f(n, m)$ for given integer values, $n$ and $m$. In particular, find $f(12, 6)$ given: $f(x,y)=f(x-y,y-1)+2$ when $x>y$, $x+y$ otherwise.

Problem 4: Complete the following activities from Chapter 7 of https://opendsaserver.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/CS2/html/index.html:
- Complete three activities from section 7.3
- Complete two activities from section 7.5
- Complete two activities from section 7.6

In each case, submit a screenshot of your code and the feedback.
