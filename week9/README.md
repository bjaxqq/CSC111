### Week 9: Node ADT Activity

# Instructions:
1. Implement the `Node` class shown in the handout. Test the class by implementing a `main` method that uses each constructor and each method.
2. Create four nodes with each `next` variable set to `null`. For example,
```
Node n1 = new Node('a', null);
```
Create a 4-node linked list by setting the `next` variable of the one node to a different node. For example,
```
n1.setNext(n2);
```
The `next` variable for the last node should remain `null`.
3. Print the contents of each node
