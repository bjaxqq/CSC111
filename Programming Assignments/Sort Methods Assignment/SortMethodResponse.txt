1. Which of the sorting methods that you implemented performs best? Briefly explain your answer.

Merge Sort performs the best. It requires the least number of comparisons, and its time complexity of O(n log n) is more efficient.

2. Which of the sorting methods that you implemented performs worst? Briefly explain your answer.

Bubble sort performs the worst. It requires the most number of comparisons, and its time complexity of O(n^2) is least efficient.

3. How does the data gathered for each sort method you implemented compare to its theoretical performance? 
3. Assuming the theoretical performance differs from the data gathered, explain the purpose of theoretical performance.

The theoretical performance matches up well. The time complexities especially show the efficiencies work in an actual application.
Selection, bubble, and merge all show through testing that their time complexities match up.
