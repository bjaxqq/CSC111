# CSC111

### Course Description

This course is a continuation of [CSC 110](https://github.com/bjaxqq/CSC110). Topics include advanced data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables), recursion, abstract data types, introductory algorithms, and intermediate object-oriented programming. A [lab](https://github.com/bjaxqq/CSC111L) is included.

### Tools and Languages Used

This course moved away from Scala and started to use Java to explore more complex topics of object-oriented programming. Coding was done in Visual Studio Code.
